    "text": "Important information\n\nDress code\nThe dress code for the wedding and reception is cocktail attire (Melbourne translation: racewear). That being said, please make sure to wear something in which you feel glamorous, amazing, and comfortable!\nWe are hoping (touch wood, fingers and toes crossed) for a pleasant summer’s day. We may; however, have a very hot day or it may rain. We have contingency plans for both of these outcomes and will let you know if we need to make any adjustments.\nWeather permitting, the ceremony will be held in a park. You will be standing and walking on grass.\n\n\nTravelling to and from each venue\n\nTo the ceremony\nWe strongly recommend using public transport or catching a taxi to get to Blues Point Reserve. There is very limited parking near the park.\n\n\nClosest ferry stop  \nMcMahon’s Point\n\nLink to map\n\n\nClosest train stop  \nNorth Sydney\n\nLink to map\n\n\nNicest train stop from which to walk \nMilson’s Point\n\nLink to map\n\n\nClosest bus stop  \nBlues Point Rd at Warung St\n\nLink to map\n\n\n\n\nIf you arrive early at Blues Point Reserve, we recommend getting a quick drink at the Blues Point Hotel. The rooftop patio is lovely (but hot!).\n\n\nTo the reception\n\nHarbour cruise (…kind of)\nDeclan and I will be catching the ferry to Circular Quay, taking the train to Stanmore Station, and then walking the short distance to Emma’s Snack Bar. Everyone is welcome to join us!\nThe easiest way to travel on public transport in Sydney is using an Opal card; however, you can also tap on and off using a credit card. Please make sure to bring one of these with you to the ceremony if you want to join our (not so private) harbour cruise!\n\n\nThe slightly more practical option\nWe will also be ordering taxis to take those who would prefer to drive to the reception.\n\n\n\nTo the after party\nJacoby’s Tiki Bar is a short six-minute (450 m) walk from Emma’s Snack Bar. We will walk over after the reception.\nWe will also order taxis for anyone with mobility issues or tired feet. Jacoby’s has seating (including some very comfortable booths) for those who need it."

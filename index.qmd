## Important information

### Dress code

The dress code for the wedding and reception is cocktail attire. That being said, please make sure to wear something in which you feel glamorous, amazing, and comfortable!

We are hoping (touch wood, fingers and toes crossed) for a pleasant summer's day. We may; however, have a very hot day or it may rain. We have contingency plans for both of these outcomes and will let you know if we need to make any adjustments.

Weather permitting, the ceremony will be held in a park. You will be standing and walking on grass.

### Travelling to and from each venue

#### To the ceremony

We *strongly* recommend using public transport or catching a taxi to get to Blues Point Reserve. There is very limited parking near the park.

If you arrive early at Blues Point Reserve, we recommend getting a quick drink at the [Blues Point Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/dzWCCoox4duQ34ybA). The rooftop patio is lovely (but hot!).

#### To the reception

##### Harbour cruise (...kind of)

Declan and I will be catching the ferry to Circular Quay, taking the train to Stanmore Station, and then walking the short distance to Emma's Snack Bar. Everyone is welcome to join us!

*The easiest way to travel on public transport in Sydney is using an [Opal card](https://transportnsw.info/tickets-opal/opal); however, you can also tap on and off using a credit card. Please make sure to bring one of these with you to the ceremony if you want to join our (not so private) harbour cruise!*

##### The slightly more practical option

We will also be ordering taxis to take those who would prefer to drive to the reception.

#### To the after party

Jacoby's Tiki Bar is a short six-minute (450 m) walk from Emma's Snack Bar. We will walk over after the reception.

We will also order taxis for anyone with mobility issues or tired feet. Jacoby's has seating (including some very comfortable booths) for those who need it.

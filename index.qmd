## Important information

### Dress code

The dress code for the celebration is cocktail attire. Declan and I will be wearing our suit and dress (respectively...) from our Australian wedding.

### Gifts

We are very excited to celebrate this wonderful day with you all. Getting to catch up and share this day with you is more than enough of a gift, and most people are travelling to be here, so please do not feel obliged to get us anything. 

If you absolutely must get us a gift, we really appreciate your generosity. We are currently putting together a registry and will update this space shortly. 

One important note: we will be leaving Ireland with only a small backpack each. We cannot take large items with us. 

## RSVP

Please RSVP to Declan at dmolloy3@gmail.com.

See you soon!
